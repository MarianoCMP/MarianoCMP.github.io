            <p>
            A disciplined college student motivated and determined to look for experience in the 
            tech-field. Always trying to gain knowledge about computers and networks which the 
            world relies heavily on. It's fascinating to see how technology can help the underprivileged.
            Personally being in tough times, I found joy in technology (hardware) and later found programming 
            as a challenge.
